# Python_projects_for_github
Showcase of python projects I have made

List of project descriptions:

- One_Liner_Python_Games -> this contains various attempts to create 
  simple python programs that create visual mazes in as little code as possible
- django_trial_on_mac -> this is a django web-app I made as an example of integrating html/css with a python MVC structure.
